# Interactive-map-of-Places-i-want-to-visit-in-europe-
Interactive map of places where i want to visit. When you click on the markers, instagram photos that i saved will pop up. I was interested from this link https://github.com/Pubs-of-Oxfordshire-Map
For the below image i provided coordinates and instagram urls of the photos. Clicking to the marker pops up the instagram photo.

Right now i am trying to impove my code by doing the following steps:
1) Providing list of places i want to visit in Europe. This is a piravate list that i created in instagram. Below image shows the instagram website where the photos i saved from the Instagram app goes.

This web page is piravate and only accesible to my account. So I will use the html code of it ( probably javascript will cause some issues but i will provide the data accordingly) and extract instagram links of the individual photos, which is accessible by any browser.
2)Next step will be extracting information from the individual photos. Each photo that i saved to my instagram "Germany" list includes adresses. I can't access to the address information by just looking at the html code, because they are hidden with the javascript barrier. I am looking for solutions for this. 
3)After that i will have to transform addresses into latitude and longitude, and i have already written code for that and it works. 
4)I will have coordinate information and corresponding instagram link to a photo. I will plug this information to my initial mapping code.
